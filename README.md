This project focuses on classifying comments from tens of Reddit threads using 
deep learning techniques. Developed in R, the objective is to accurately categorize comments based on sentiment, topic, or any other 
criteria defined in the project scope. By leveraging advanced natural language 
processing (NLP) and deep learning methodologies, we aim to understand the diverse range of discussions on Reddit more systematically.

Data Collection: Automated scripts to fetch comments from specified Reddit threads using Reddit API.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis, including tokenization, normalization, and vectorization.
Model Development: Utilizing deep learning models in R for comment classification. The models explored include LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Units), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for text classification.
Evaluation: Metrics to assess model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization: Graphs and charts to visualize the classification results and model performance.
